------------- CONTENTS ----------------

This repository contains the .csv files containing the raw output of all experiments.
The experiments were run over two sets of benchmarks:
a) TPTP benchmarks
b) Sledgehammer benchmarks
The names of the .csv files link them directly to the benchmarks described in the paper.

---------- OBTAINING SOLVERS ----------

The Vampire binary used in the experiment can be obtained at:

http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~regerg/files/vampire_ho_schedule.zip

The CASC-2019 versions of Leo-III 1.4, Satallax 3.4, Vampire-THF 4.4 and Zipperosition 1.5  
were utilised in experiments. These can be obtained from the ATPSystems space of 
StarExec Miama:
